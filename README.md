SSH easily!

### First time setup

We use ReactJs, Babel and webpack to manage and version our assets (javascript, css). Here's how to to do it:
  - Install node modules. You only need to run this command again if there's any update in the file package.json
```sh
$ npm install
```
  - Running the Server
```sh
$ npm start
```
  - Generating the bundle
```sh
$ npm run build
```
